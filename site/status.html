[ESITE BEGIN]
<p>Since eSite is new project<a class="footnote-reference" href="#fn1" id="fn1ref">1</a>, there is not that much to say at this point. I'll soon have the parser and some documents and a minimal eSite sample site posted in CVS to play around with.</p>
<h2>Parser</h2>
<p>The eSite parser, esite, currently has the following capabilities and limitations:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Capabilities</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Traverses directories 1 deep, parsing and copying files from those directories.</li>
<li>Code inside a <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> block is preserved, so that PHP documents can be developed.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Limitations</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>No code library to assist users in developing scalable templates.</li>
<li>Even minimal templates are excessively complex.</li>
<li>The esite tool can only be used to build a website on a local file system.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Limitations With PHP 4.x</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Nested directories must contain at least 1 file to be copied or parsed or further nested directories containing such items will not work correctly.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Known Bugs</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>All files not in the exclude or parse list are copied from the source directory to the build directory irregardless of the contents of the copy files list.</li>
<li>Backups of copied files are copied.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p class="footnote"><a href="#fn1ref" id="fn1">1:</a> The reality is not that eSite is a new project, but it is a rethinking and recycling of a project that was abandoned a couple of years ago.</p>
[ESITE END]
