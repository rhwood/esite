<h2>esite, the eSite parser</h2>
<p>esite, the parser for the eSite project, is currently available as a <a href="esite.zip">ZIP archive.</a> As things stand right now, it is very weak in the documentation department and its operation may be a bit cryptic until that is fixed. Expect documentation for the parser around the 15th of September, and for it to be under CVS control by the 25th of September.</p>
<p><a href="esite.zip">Download it now!</a></p>
<h2>The eSite website code</h2>
<p>while the eSite website is by no means complex, it is probably the best example of how I concieved of eSite working. As of now, it contains all documentation except comments within the esite parser.</p>
